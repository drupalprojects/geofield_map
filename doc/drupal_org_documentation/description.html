  <li>The Geofield Map View style plugin will pass to the client js (as drupalSettings.geofield_google_map[mapid] & Drupal.geoFieldMap[mapid] variables) the un-hidden fields values of the View, as markers/features' properties data;</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Geofield Map 2.x Dynamic Markers Theming & Legends Specifications</strong></h3>

<p>Geofield Map 2.x introduces the MapThemer Plugin system that allows the definition of MapThemer Plugins able to dinamically differentiate Map Features/Markers based on Contents Types, Taxonomy Terms, Values, etc.
  Each Plugin Type provides the automatic definition of a related Legend Build, that is able to fill the definition of a Custom GeofieldMapLegend block.</p>

<p>At the moment the following two Geofield Map Themers plugin types have been defined:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Custom Icon Image File, allows the definition of a unique custom Marker Icon, valid for all the Map Markers;</li>
  <li> Entity Type, allows the definition of different Marker Icons based on the View filtered Entity Types/Bundles;</li>
  <li> Taxonomy Term, allows the definition of different Marker Icons based on Taxonomy Terms reference field in View;</li>
</ul>

<p>As Drupal 8 Plugin system based, the Geofield MapThemers Plugin and Legend block system is fully extendable and overridable.
  You, as D8 developer, are free to override and extend the existing ones, or create your custom MapThemer based on your specific needs and logics.</p>

<h4>How to use.</h4>

<p>In a Geofield Map View Display, just go into its settings and choose the wanted MapThemer in the new Map Theming Options section/fieldset.
  It is possible to associate a Drupal Managed File for each MapThemer plugin value and even the Icon Image style the Icon should be rendered on the Map. The Value labels and Icons might have an alias, might be reordered and might be hidden from the correspondent Legend Block.<p>

<p>Once defined and configured the Legend you are free to place it, once or several times, as a normal Drupal 8 block on the pages, with your logics and contextual rules.</p>

<h4><strong>Notes & Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Geofield Map module depends from the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield" title="Geofield" target="_blank">Geofield</a> module;</li>
  <li>A valid <u>Gmap Api Key is needed</u> for Google Maps rendering, and for any Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding functionalities, as actually based on the Google Geocoder;</li>
  <li>Although in mind, there is no <u>Leaflet Map library support</u> at the moment for the Geofield Map Formatter and the  Map Views Plugin. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet" title="Leaflet" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> and the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet_markercluster" title="Leaflet Markercluster" target="_blank">Leaflet Markercluster</a> modules for Leaflet front-end mapping of Drupal 8 Geofields;</li>
</ul>
